Test Store is RevenueCat's built-in testing environment that works immediately without platform setup.

Test Store works automatically with the RevenueCat SDK—no additional configuration is required beyond using your Test Store API key. Test purchases made through Test Store **behave like real purchases and subscriptions**: they update `CustomerInfo`, trigger entitlements, and appear in your RevenueCat dashboard.

:::info\[SDK Version Requirements]
Test Store requires the following minimum SDK versions:

| Platform     | Minimum Version |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| iOS          | 5.43.0          |
| Android      | 9.9.0           |
| Flutter      | 9.8.0           |
| React Native | 9.5.4           |
| Capacitor    | 11.2.6          |
| Cordova      | 7.2.0           |
| Unity        | 8.3.0           |
| KMP          | 2.2.2           |
| Web (JS)     | 1.15.0          |

Older SDK versions will not support Test Store products.

## Getting started

During the setup of a *new* RevenueCat project, a Test Store will be automatically created with products. You can create them manually following the steps below.

1. Create a Test Store
2. Configure test products and offerings
3. Initialize the SDK with your Test Store API key
4. Make test purchases in your app

### Create a Test Store

If you have not created a Test Store for this project, create one on the **Apps and providers** tab in the sidebar. In the *Test configuration* section, create a new Test Store and you will be presented with an API key to use in the SDK.

### Configure test products and offerings

Next, create products and attach them to an offering so users can purchase them in your app. Do this in the **Product catalog** tab in the sidebar. Create products for the Test Store in the **Products** tab, then attach those products to an offering in the **Offerings** tab. Alternatively, if you already have an existing offering, you can create the Test Store products directly on the offering edit page.

### Changing Test Store products and prices

Test Store products are configured at creation time. You cannot edit an existing product's identifier, duration, or price in the dashboard after it has been saved — there is no in-place edit control on the product page.

To use a different price (or duration):

1. Create a **new** Test Store product with the updated price.
2. In **Offerings**, replace the old product in the package with the new one (or create the Test Store product from the offering edit page).
3. Optionally **archive** the old product once nothing references it.

Creating a new product instead of editing also keeps historical data cleaner if you later compare prices in Experiments.

### Initialize the SDK with your Test Store API key

To configure your SDK to use the Test Store instead of the real store, use the **Test Store API Key** generated above whenever you [initialize the RevenueCat SDK](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/getting-started/configuring-sdk#testing-with-test-store). Before shipping to production, switch this key back to the platform-specific API keys for each platform your app supports. You can find all your keys in **Project Settings > API keys**.

:::danger\[CRITICAL: Never submit apps with a Test Store API key]
**Never submit an app to the App Store or Google Play that is configured with a Test Store API key.** Always use the correct platform-specific API key (iOS, Android, etc.) for release builds.

We recommend using build configurations or environment variables to automatically select the correct API key for each build type:

- **Development/Debug builds**: Test Store API key
- **Production/Release builds**: Platform-specific API key (iOS, Android, etc.)\
  :::

### Make test purchases in your app

Once the SDK is configured with the correct Test Store API key, you can start making test purchases in your app. Instead of invoking the system in-app purchase flow, your app will present a modal with metadata about the product being purchased, along with buttons to simulate a successful purchase, a failed purchase, or cancel the purchase entirely.

Use these options to manually test how your code responds to different in-app purchase outcomes, or to write automated integration tests without interacting with real store flows.

Purchases through Test Store will be reported as sandbox data. Learn more at [Viewing Non-Production Data](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/test-and-launch/sandbox#viewing-non-production-data).

:::tip\[Control test purchase behavior]
You can control whether test purchases (both Test Store and platform sandboxes) grant entitlements using [Sandbox Testing Access](https://www.revenuecat.com/docs/projects/sandbox-access) settings. This is useful for restricting testing to specific app user IDs.

## Subscription renewals and expiration

When testing subscriptions in the Test Store, renewals and expirations occur much faster than with real purchases. **Each test subscription will renew automatically up to 5 times**, after which it will cancel and its associated entitlements will become inactive.

| Product Duration | Test Store Renewal Interval | Total Time Until Subscription Ends (after 5 renewals) |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 week           | 5 minutes                   | 25 minutes                                            |
| 1 month          | 5 minutes                   | 25 minutes                                            |
| 2 months         | 10 minutes                  | 50 minutes                                            |
| 3 months         | 15 minutes                  | 75 minutes                                            |
| 6 months         | 30 minutes                  | 150 minutes                                           |
| 1 year           | 1 hour                      | 5 hours                                               |
